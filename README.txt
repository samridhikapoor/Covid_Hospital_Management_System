MEDIBAY - Empowering People to Improve Their Lives

The outbreak of Coronavirus in the world has big implications for the world. 
The closure of higher education institutions as well as the broader measures undertaken in many countries to restrict
 mobility of citizens and increase social distancing hampers the regular implementation of most of the ongoing or planned activities. 
The Commission and the Agency are acutely aware of the difficulties faced by project beneficiaries in this respect. 
Our foremost concern, is the safety and protection of all the citizens.
